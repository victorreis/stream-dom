## Introduction

A simple and intuitive DOM streamer to watch a tetris game.
The main objective of this project is to practice some development skills through some technologies and concepts:

- ReactJS

- TypeScript
- CSS-in-JS (emotion.js)
- Nest.js
- Turborepo
- Caching

## Features

- [X] The product manager should be able to see the list of all current and recent (<1 day old) sessions (just showing session idâ€™s is fine)
- [X] The product manager should be able to watch any active session in real-time. Or rewind to a previous point in the active session
- [X] The product manager should be able to replay any old session
- [X] For realtime streaming active sessions, latency is important! We suggest websockets
